<h1>🛡️ Threat Hunts – Cyber Range Community Investigations</h1>

Welcome to my Threat Hunts repository — a curated collection of investigations from the Cyber Range Community Threat Hunts, competitive blue-team exercises, and hands-on SOC/DFIR challenges.

These hunts mirror real-world adversary behavior and are used by the community to:
<ul>
    <li>Benchmark detection abilities</li>
    <li>Strengthen IR methodologies</li>
    <li>Develop KQL expertise</li>
    <li>Practice end-to-end threat analysis</li>
    <li>Compete and collaborate with other analysts</li>
</ul>

This repository documents my progress and skills as part of these ongoing hunts.


<h2>Repository Purpose</h2>

This repo serves as:
<ul>
    <li>A portfolio of completed threat hunts</li>
    <li>A demonstration of SOC, DFIR, and detection engineering skills</li>
    <li>A record of my contributions to community threat hunt competitions</li>
    <li>A showcase of KQL query building and attack chain reconstruction</li>
    <li>A resource for other analysts studying similar attack behaviors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Each hunt folder contains:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A complete Incident Response Report</li>
    <li>Detailed attack chain analysis</li>
    <li>MITRE ATT&CK mapping</li>
    <li>All relevant KQL queries</li>
    <li>Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)</li>
    <li>Timeline & evidence screenshots</li>
