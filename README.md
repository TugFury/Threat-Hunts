🛡️ Threat Hunts – Cyber Range Community Investigations

Welcome to my Threat Hunts repository — a curated collection of investigations from the Cyber Range Community Threat Hunts, competitive blue-team exercises, and hands-on SOC/DFIR challenges.

These hunts mirror real-world adversary behavior and are used by the community to:
<ul>
    <li>Benchmark detection abilities<li>
    <li>Strengthen IR methodologies</li>
    <li>Develop KQL expertise</li>
    <li>Practice end-to-end threat analysis</li>
    <li>Compete and collaborate with other analysts</li>
</ul>

This repository documents my progress and skills as part of these ongoing hunts.
