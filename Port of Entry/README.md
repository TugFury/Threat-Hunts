<h1>🛡️ Port of Entry – RDP Intrusion (2025)</h1>
Cyber Range Community Threat Hunt Case Study

This directory contains the complete investigation, forensic analysis, and incident response documentation for the Azuki Port of Entry  RDP Intrusion, a structured threat hunt challenge from the Cyber Range Community Threat Hunting Competition. 

I completed this hunt as part of a competitive blue-team event and achieved a 4th place finish, demonstrating strong threat-hunting speed, accuracy, and IR methodology.

The scenario simulated a targeted compromise against Azuki Import/Export, a logistics company in Japan/SE Asia.

During the intrusion, the attacker:
<ul>
    <li>Used RDP with stolen credentials</li>
    <li>Disabled security tools</li>
    <li>Established a hidden staging directory</li>
    <li>Dumped credentials from LSASS</li>
    <li>Archived and exfiltrated contract data</li>
    <li>Maintained persistence</li>
    <li>Attempted lateral movement</li>
</ul>
